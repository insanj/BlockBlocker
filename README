BlockBlocker - Don't Let Users Block Up Blocks!
Version: v1.1

After installing BlockBlocker, by default no user will be able to place any block against a sign. However, if the command "/bb" is issued, a configuration file will be generated inside your plugin folder. In there, just list all the MATERIALS you want blocked, and ta-da! All the materials in the game are supported, check the Bukkit documentation/list on Materials for the entire listing of what you can use.

Features:
Prevents placing blocks against listed signs.
Generates a config on command (/bb), and prevents users from placing blocks against those materials!
